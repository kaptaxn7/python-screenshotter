:warning: whatever u do with this is all ur fault im just doing this for educational purposes - i am not liable for any damage and or crimes committed thx

instead of sending someone a .py file, it's probably a better idea to convert it to an .exe using something like [nkita](https://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html)
